I have just completed my PhD in Statistics at Bocconi University, under the supervision of [Antonio Lijoi](http://mypage.unibocconi.it/antoniolijoi/), [Igor Pr√ºnster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=) and [Matteo Ruggiero](https://www.matteoruggiero.it). Currently I am Lecturer and will start as Assistant Professor on July 1, 2024 at the Department of Statistical Science at [Duke University](https://stat.duke.edu/).

Furthermore, I am a member of [Bayes Lab](https://www.bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Cdr/Bayeslab/Home), a research unit of the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics [BIDSA](https://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home), of the MIDAS [Complex Data Modelling Research Network](https://midas.mat.uc.cl/network/) and of the ["de Castro" Statistics Initiative](https://www.carloalberto.org/research/statistics-initiative/) at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/). I am currently Secretary of the [Young Italian Statistical Society](https://youngsis.github.io/) and Program Chair of [j-ISBA](https://j-isba.github.io/).
